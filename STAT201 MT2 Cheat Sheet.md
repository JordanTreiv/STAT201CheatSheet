## Module 6: Hypothesis Testing
***The Basic Steps***
- State hypotheses
- Set significance level
- Collect data
- Calculate test statistic
- Calculate P-value
- Draw a conclusion

**State Hypotheses**

In general, we have two hypothesis 𝐻0, called the null hypothesis, and 𝐻1 (or 𝐻𝐴), the alternative hypothesis.

The null hypothesis is the status quo, what you should conclude if there’s no evidence to say otherwise.
For example unless we see "strong" evidence that a new, untested drug works, we are going to assume that it does not.

Typically, the null is of the form:

𝐻0 = ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

And the alternative is of the form: 

𝐻𝐴 < ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

𝐻𝐴 > ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

𝐻𝐴 ≠ ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

### Code(Module 6)

**STEP 1:**

Identify Hypotheses:

𝐻0 = x

-------------------------------------------------------------

𝐻𝐴 < x

*or*

𝐻𝐴 > x

*or*

𝐻𝐴 ≠ x


Identify Response and Explanatory variables:

x = Response

y = Explanatory

**The Code:**



*(The following is for a categorical variable)*

First we *specify* response and/or explanatory variables:

```r
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)
```
Next, we create the null and alternative *hypotheses*:

Note, for ``hypothesize:"" `` we enter:

"independence" for when there are 2 samples

"point" for wheb there is 1 sample.

```r
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)%>%
hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")
```

Next, we *generate* replicates:

Note, for ``generate:"" `` we enter:

"bootstrap" for when we replicate ***WITH*** replacement

"permute" for when we replicate ***WITHOUT*** replacement

```r 
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)%>%
hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")%>%
generate(reps = DESIRED_REPLICATES, type = "ENTER_TYPE_HER")

```








*(The following is for a continuous variable)*

First we *specify* response and/or explanatory variables:

```r
specify(response = Response)
```
Next, we create the null and alternative *hypotheses*:

Note, for ``hypothesize:"" `` we enter:

"independence" for when there are 2 samples

"point" for when there is 1 sample.

```r
specify(response = Response) %>% 
hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")
```

Next, we *generate* replicates:

Note, for ``generate:"" `` we enter:

"bootstrap" for when we replicate ***WITH*** replacement

"permute" for when we replicate ***WITHOUT*** replacement

```r
specify(response = Response)%>%
hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")%>%
generate(reps = DESIRED_REPLICATES, type = "ENTER_TYPE_HER")
```
