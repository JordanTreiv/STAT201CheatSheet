## Module 6: Hypothesis Testing
***The Basic Steps***
- State hypotheses
- Set significance level
- Collect data
- Calculate test statistic
- Calculate P-value
- Draw a conclusion

**State Hypotheses**

In general, we have two hypothesis 𝐻0, called the null hypothesis, and 𝐻1 (or 𝐻𝐴), the alternative hypothesis.

The null hypothesis is the status quo, what you should conclude if there’s no evidence to say otherwise.
For example unless we see "strong" evidence that a new, untested drug works, we are going to assume that it does not.

Typically, the null is of the form:

𝐻0 = ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

And the alternative is of the form: 

𝐻𝐴 < ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

𝐻𝐴 > ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

𝐻𝐴 ≠ ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter


## Module 7: Confidence Intervals (of means and proportions) based on the assumption of Normality or the Central Limit Theorem


## Module 8: Theory-based Hypothesis Tests
