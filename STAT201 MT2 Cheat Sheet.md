## Module 6: Hypothesis Testing
***The Basic Steps***
- State hypotheses
- Set significance level
- Collect data
- Calculate test statistic
- Calculate P-value
- Draw a conclusion

**State Hypotheses**

In general, we have two hypothesis ùêª0, called the null hypothesis, and ùêª1 (or ùêªùê¥), the alternative hypothesis.

The null hypothesis is the status quo, what you should conclude if there‚Äôs no evidence to say otherwise.
For example unless we see "strong" evidence that a new, untested drug works, we are going to assume that it does not.

Typically, the null is of the form:

ùêª0 = ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

And the alternative is of the form: 

ùêªùê¥ < ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

ùêªùê¥ > ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

ùêªùê¥ ‚â† ***p*** ; for some p Population Parameter

### Code(Module 6)

**STEP 1:**

Identify Hypotheses:

ùêª0 = x

-------------------------------------------------------------

ùêªùê¥ < x

*or*

ùêªùê¥ > x

*or*

ùêªùê¥ ‚â† x


Identify Response and Explanatory variables:

x = Response

y = Explanatory

**The Code:**

First, we find the *observed test statistic* from the original sample

```r
obs_test_stat <- data %>% 
  specify(Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor %>% 
  calculate(stat = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")
obs_test_stat
```

*(The following is for a categorical variable)*

We start the null model by using *specify* to identify response and/or explanatory variables:

```r
null_model_dist <- data %>%
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)
```
Next, we create the null and alternative *hypotheses*:

Note, for ``hypothesize:"" `` we enter:

"independence" for when there are 2 samples

"point" for wheb there is 1 sample.

```r
null_model_dist <- data %>%
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)%>%
hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")
```

Next, we *generate* replicates:

Note, for ``generate:"" `` we enter:

"bootstrap" for when we replicate ***WITH*** replacement

"permute" for when we replicate ***WITHOUT*** replacement

```r 
null_model_dist <- data %>%
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)%>%
hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")%>%
generate(reps = DESIRED_REPLICATES, type = "ENTER_TYPE_HER")
```
After this, we *calculate* summary statistics:

Note, for ``calculate(stat= "") `` we enter:

"mean" - for calculating the means

"median" - for calculating the medians

"sum" - for calculating the summs

"sd" - for calculating the standard deviations

"prop" - for calculating the proportions

"count" - for calculating the total counts

"diff in means" - for calculating the difference in means **(ONLY FOR ``hypothesize(null = "independence"))`` )**

"diff in medians" - for calculating the difference in medians **(ONLY FOR ``hypothesize(null = "independence))`` )**

"diff in props" - for calculating the difference in proportions **(ONLY FOR ``hypothesize(null = "independence))`` )** 


```r
null_model_dist <- data %>%
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)%>%
hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")%>%
generate(reps = DESIRED_REPLICATES, type = "ENTER_TYPE_HER")%>%
calculate(stat = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")
# for calculate(stat = "diff in SMTH"), you can add the order of taking the difference like:
# calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("var1", "var2"))
```

To *visualize* the p-value, we do:

```r
null_model_dist_vis <- 
visualize(null_model_dist, bins = 10)
```

We can further shade in the region with the p-value depending on our Alternative Hypothesis:

Note, for ``shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_test_stat, direction = "")``, for direction, we enter:

"right" - ùêªùê¥ > ***p*** 

"left" - ùêªùê¥ < ***p*** 

"both" - for when ùêªùê¥ ‚â† ***p***

```r
null_model_dist_vis <- 
visualize(null_model_dist, bins = 10)%>%
shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_test_stat, direction = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")
```
It should look something like this (for direction = "right"):

Finally, we need to get our p-value, which we will compare with our significance level, and then determine wether or not to reject the null

```r
get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_test_stat, direction = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")
```

Remember, this will spit out a *percentage* which represents the probability of getting a value *more extreme* than the test statistic.
If the p-value is smaller than the ‚ç∫ level(significance level), we *reject the null*. Otherwise, we do not.

From here, if we so wish, we can easily continue to making confidence intervals with a few easy changes:

```r
bootstrap_distribution <- data %>% 
specify(formula = Response ~ Explanatory, success = someCategoricalFactor)%>% 
# Change 1 - Remove hypothesize():
# hypothesize(null = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE") %>% 
# Change 2 - make the generate type = "bootstrap":
generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
calculate(stat = "ENTER_TYPE_HERE")%>%
```

```r
percentile_ci <- bootstrap_distribution %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = ENTER_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_HERE, type = "percentile")
```

Next, we visualize the confidence interval:

```r
ci_vis <-
visualize(bootstrap_distribution) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci)
```

It should look like:

## Module 7: Confidence Intervals (of means and proportions) based on the assumption of Normality or the Central Limit Theorem

**The General Idea**
- Describe the Law of Large Numbers.
- Describe a normal distribution.
- Explain the Central Limit Theorem and other general asymptotic results (such as for quantiles), and their role in constructing confidence intervals.
- Write a computer script to calculate confidence intervals based on the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem.
- Discuss the potential limitations of these methods.
- Decide whether to use asymptotic theory or bootstrapping to compute estimator uncertainty.

### Normal(Gaussian) distribution

**Fitting a normal curve on a normal distribution:**

```r
pop_dist_normal <- 
    data %>% 
    ggplot() + 
    geom_histogram(aes(x = RESPONSEVAR , y = ..density..), color = 'white', binwidth = 0.198)+
    theme(text = element_text(size=25)) +
    xlab("XLABEL") +
    ylab("Count") + 
    ggtitle("DISTRIBUTION_TITLE")+
    geom_line(data = data_normal, aes(x = RESPONSEVAR, y = density), color="red", lwd = 2)
```

This should look something like:

**Characteristics of a Normal Curve/Distribution:**

The Normal Curve is described by N(Œº,œÉ) such that:

Œº (Mu): Describes the center/mean of the curve. Controls the location of the curve.

œÉ (Sigma): Describes the standard devaition/spread of the curve. Controls its spread. As œÉ increases, the curve becomes wider, and vice versa

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Approximately 68% of the observations are between [Œº - 1œÉ ; Œº + 1œÉ]
- Approximately 95% of the observations are between [Œº - 2œÉ ; Œº + 2œÉ]
- Approximately 99.7% of the observations are between [Œº - 3œÉ ; Œº + 3œÉ]
